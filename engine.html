    <h3>
      For the W140 series, a new generation of inline-6 and V8 petrol engines
      was developed with double-overhead camshafts (DOHC), four valves per
      cylinder, and new variable valve timing. Mercedes-Benz's first passenger
      V12 engine was introduced in 1991 in a response to BMW's 750i/750iL (E32).
      Only the 3.5-litre inline-6 diesel engine, OM 603.97x, was carried over
      from W126, and it remained the only engine in the W140 model range with a
      two-valves-per-cylinder format until its replacement in 1996. The advent
      of DOHC, with four valves per cylinder and accompanied by variable valve
      timing, helped to increase the horsepower and torque figures without
      imposing a heavy fuel-consumption penalty, all while reducing emissions.
      All petrol engines were equipped with catalytic converters during the
      entire W140 model run, regardless of where they were sold. M 104 petrol
      engine was introduced in 1992 with two displacements: the smaller
      2.8-litre M 104.94x engine was fitted to 300 SE 2.8 (one year only) then S
      280 (1994-1998); the larger 3.2-litre M 104.99x engine was fitted to 300
      SE/300 SEL (one year only) then S 320 (1994–1998). The M 119 V8 engines
      were available in 4.2-litre (M 119 E 42) and 5.0-litre (M 119 E 50)
      versions and remained unchanged during its entire model run. In 1994, AMG
      developed a 6.0-litre version (M 119 E 60) with 279 kW (379 PS; 374 bhp)
      and 580 N⋅m (428 lb⋅ft) in a very limited production for Japanese market.
      The S 500 AMG 6.0 and CL 500 AMG 6.0 were built from 1994 to 1999 per
      customer order.[17] For 1993, the V8 engines were detuned for improved
      emission control. The M 120 V12 engine was offered in 6.0 litres only for
      the entire model run. This engine developed 290–300 kW (394–408 PS;
      389–402 hp) and 569–580 N⋅m (420–428 lb⋅ft) of torque. The 300 kW (408 PS;
      402 bhp) version was available in Europe from 1991 to 1992 and in the
      United States for 1992 only. In 1993, the V12 was slightly detuned to 290
      kW (394 PS; 389 bhp) for lower emission control. An AMG-prepared 6.0-litre
      M 120 V12 with higher performance rating, 327 kW (445 PS; 439 hp) and 623
      N⋅m (460 lb⋅ft), was only available for S- or CL-Class (C140) coupes and
      not S-Class sedans/saloons. The 3.5-litre inline-6 diesel engine, OM
      603.97x in the 300 SD TURBODIESEL (1991–1993) and S 350 TURBODIESEL
      (1994–1996) models was offered outside the North American and Japanese
      markets for the first time. This engine was replaced in 1996 by the
      entirely new 24-valve OM 606.961 ERE engine. This engine was loosely
      derived from the M 104 petrol engine, but with a different crankshaft and
      cylinder head. The smaller engine fitted to S 300 TURBODIESEL put out 130
      kW (177 PS; 174 hp) and 330 N⋅m (243 lb⋅ft). The fuel was delivered
      indirectly in the precombustion chamber before entering the combustion
      chamber.
