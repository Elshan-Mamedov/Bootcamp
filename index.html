    <h3>
      The Mercedes-Benz W140 is a series of flagship vehicles manufactured by
      Mercedes-Benz from 1991 to 1998 in sedan/saloon and coupe body styles and
      two wheelbase lengths (SE and SEL). Mercedes-Benz unveiled the W140
      S-Class at Geneva Motor Show in March 1991 with sales launch in April 1991
      and North American launch on 6 August 1991. All models were renamed in
      June 1993 as part of the corporate-wide nomenclature changes for 1994
      model year on, becoming S regardless of wheelbase length or body style as
      well as fuel type. Diesel models carried a TURBODIESEL trunk/boot lid
      label. In 1996, the S-Class coupé was renamed again as CL-Class into its
      own model range.The W140 series S-Class was superseded by the W220 S-Class
      sedan and C215 CL-Class coupé in 1998 after an eight-year production run.
      The W140 is named "The ghost / الشّبح" in Arab countries due to its
      wide-body look. Production of the W140 reached 432,732,[3] with 406,710
      sedans and 26,022 coupés.
